## üìÅ Files

- `lighthouse.config.js` - Healthcare-optimized Lighthouse configuration
- `performance-budget.json` - Detailed healthcare performance budgets
- `budget-check.js` - Automated budget enforcement script
- `size-report.json` - Generated bundle size report (created by scripts)

## üö® CI/CD Integration

The performance budget check will fail the build if:
- Bundle sizes exceed healthcare limits
- Accessibility score falls below 90
- Performance score falls below 80
- Critical components exceed emergency loading thresholds

## üè• Healthcare Context

These budgets are specifically designed for:
- **Stressed medical users** who need fast, reliable access
- **Mobile healthcare professionals** often on slow 3G networks
- **Accessibility users** including screen readers and motor impairments
- **Emergency situations** where every millisecond matters

Performance is not just a technical metric - it's a healthcare quality issue that directly impacts patient care and medical professional efficiency.
