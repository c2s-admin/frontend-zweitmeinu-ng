# Medical Context (Essentials)

Short guide to healthcare-specific UX patterns used across the app/design system.

## Personas & Context
- Stressed patient: simplify, reassure, reduce cognitive load.
- Routine patient: learning flow, clear next steps.
- Healthcare professional: density allowed, fast navigation.
- Emergency user: priority actions always visible and reachable.

## Emergency UX
- Always-visible emergency entry point where relevant.
- Highest contrast, largest targets; minimal steps to action.
- Clear wording; no ambiguity; confirm destructive actions.

## Specialty Cues
- Use specialty color/labels from tokens; keep meanings consistent.
- Avoid hardcoding colors; rely on theme and documented semantics.

## Privacy
- No PII in analytics; clear consent; minimal retention; error logs scrubbed.
